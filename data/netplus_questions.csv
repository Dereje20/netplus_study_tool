N10-009-1.1-001,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,definition,"What is the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, and why is it used in networking?",A seven-layer conceptual framework used to describe how data moves through a network and to standardize communication and troubleshooting.,"The OSI model does not define protocols; it provides a shared reference so IT professionals can quickly isolate and discuss network problems by layer (e.g., Layer 1 vs Layer 7).",1,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-002,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,definition,Define the Physical layer (Layer 1) in the OSI model and name two examples of what it includes.,"Layer 1 transmits raw bits as electrical, optical, or radio signals across physical media like cables and wireless connections.","Anything involving physical transmission—cables, fiber, signal strength, or interference—falls under Layer 1 because it deals with how data physically moves.",1,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-003,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,definition,Define the Data Link layer (Layer 2) and explain what type of address it uses to identify devices on a local network.,Layer 2 manages communication between devices on the same network using MAC addresses.,"The Data Link layer ensures frames are delivered locally and relies on hardware (MAC) addresses, which are burned into network interface cards.",2,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-004,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,scenario,"A user’s PC shows “Connected,” but the switch can’t properly forward traffic to the correct device on the same LAN. Which OSI layer is most likely involved, and what identifier is the switch using to make forwarding decisions?","Layer 2 (Data Link), using MAC addresses.","Switches operate at Layer 2 and forward traffic based on destination MAC addresses, not IP addresses, making this a Data Link layer issue.",3,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-005,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,scenario,"Two computers on different networks can’t communicate, and the issue is traced to an incorrect subnet mask on one host. Which OSI layer is being impacted, and why?",Layer 3 (Network).,"Subnet masks are part of IP addressing and routing logic, which determines how traffic moves between networks—this is handled at Layer 3.",3,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-006,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,scenario,"A user can access websites by IP address (e.g., 142.250.x.x) but cannot access them by domain name (e.g., google.com). Which OSI layer and protocol are most likely involved?","Layer 7 (Application), DNS.","DNS is an application-layer protocol. If IP connectivity works but domain names do not, the issue is with name resolution, not routing.",4,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-007,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,troubleshooting,"A wired workstation intermittently disconnects, and you suspect a cable issue. List two troubleshooting steps you would take and identify the OSI layer you’re troubleshooting.",Layer 1 (Physical).,"Loose or damaged cables cause signal loss or interference, which directly impacts the physical transmission of data.",2,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-008,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,troubleshooting,"A host can reach the default gateway, but cannot reach any external networks. Which OSI layer should you investigate first, and what device/function at that layer is most relevant?",Layer 3 (Network).,"If the default gateway is reachable, local networking works. Failure beyond that usually indicates routing or IP configuration issues.",4,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-009,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,troubleshooting,"Users report that a website loads, but login fails when the browser tries to establish a secure connection. Which OSI layer is most likely involved, and what technology is associated with that layer?",Layer 6 (Presentation).,"SSL/TLS encryption and decryption occur at the Presentation layer. If encryption fails, secure communication cannot be established.",4,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-010,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,comparison,"Compare Layer 2 vs Layer 3 by answering: what address type does each use, and what network device is most associated with each layer?",Layer 2 uses MAC addresses and switches; Layer 3 uses IP addresses and routers.,"Layer 2 handles local delivery within a network, while Layer 3 handles traffic between different networks using logical addressing.",3,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-011,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,comparison,"Compare TCP vs UDP in the context of OSI Layer 4: how does each handle delivery and reliability, and what is one reason you’d choose one over the other?",TCP is reliable and connection-oriented; UDP is fast and connectionless.,"TCP ensures delivery and order, making it suitable for web and email. UDP sacrifices reliability for speed, making it ideal for streaming and VoIP.",3,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-012,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,comparison,How is a Layer 1 problem different from a Layer 7 problem when users say “the network is down”? Give one example symptom of each.,Layer 1 failures stop all connectivity; Layer 7 failures affect specific applications.,"Physical issues prevent any communication, while application-layer problems occur even when the network itself is functional.",4,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-013,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,command,"In Wireshark, you see lines labeled Ethernet II, Internet Protocol (IP), and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). For each of these three, name the OSI layer it maps to.","Ethernet II → Layer 2, IP → Layer 3, TCP → Layer 4.","Wireshark decodes encapsulated protocols, which directly map to OSI layers based on function and addressing.",5,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-014,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,command,"In a packet capture, you see a destination port of 443. What does that strongly indicate about the traffic, and which OSI layer is responsible for the encryption/decryption process?",HTTPS traffic encrypted at Layer 6.,"Port 443 indicates HTTPS, which uses SSL/TLS encryption handled by the Presentation layer before application data is displayed.",4,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
N10-009-1.1-015,Network+,Networking Concepts,1.1 Explain and understand basic network concepts,1.1,The OSI Model,acronym,"What does MAC stand for, and which OSI layer is it most associated with? (Bonus: What is EUI and how is it related?)",MAC = Media Access Control (Layer 2); EUI = Extended Unique Identifier.,MAC addresses uniquely identify network interfaces. EUI-48 and EUI-64 are standardized formats for these hardware addresses.,2,Network Fundamentals,Messer 1.1
